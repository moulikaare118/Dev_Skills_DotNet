Write a SQL query that:

1. Calculates each student's average grade across all assignments  
2. Ranks students by average grade (highest first)  
3. Returns ONLY the TOP HALF of students based on that ranking

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------
- Use the Grades table to calculate averages.
- Average grade should be shown with 5 decimal places.
- Rank students by average grade in descending order.
- Keep only the top 50% performers.
- Final result must be ordered by avggrade (descending).

TASK
--------------------------------------------------
Write a SQL query that returns, for EACH product:

1. The month in 2023 where the product had the HIGHEST total quantity shipped.
2. The total quantity shipped in that month.
3. The product name and month name.

Rules:
- Consider ONLY shipments made in the year 2023.
- If multiple shipments happen in the same month, their quantities must be summed.
- Month must be shown as FULL TEXT (example: August).
- Products without any shipment in 2023 should NOT appear.
- Order the result by ProductName.

Expected Output Example:

ProductName | MonthName | TotalQuantity

Laptop      | April     | 60
Smartphone  | May       | 35
